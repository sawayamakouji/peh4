This Qiita article describes how to create a "file search chatbot" using Dify and Google Sheets, without programming knowledge. The chatbot helps users find files by understanding ambiguous natural language queries, unlike traditional keyword searches. The process involves organizing file information in a Google Sheet, creating a chatbot foundation in Dify, uploading the CSV as knowledge, and configuring the AI's instructions and API key. The author highlights the difference between AI search and simple Ctrl+F, emphasizing AI's ability to understand nuanced language. Future challenges include data synchronization and detecting missing files.[1]
