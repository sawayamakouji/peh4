The Qiita article details the creation of a "personal color judgment app" for clothing, categorizing items into "Spring," "Summer," "Autumn," and "Winter" based on personal color analysis. It outlines using Teachable Machines to train a model for color classification and then integrating it into a web application developed with Visual Studio Code. The app enables users to determine a garment's personal color season by taking photos or uploading images.[1]
