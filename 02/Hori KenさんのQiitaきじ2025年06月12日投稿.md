This Qiita article details how to create a sales bot using LINE, Dify, and Make, without writing code[1]. The bot allows users to scan a product's JAN code via LINE, which then uses Dify for image recognition and ChatGPT to extract the code[1]. Make integrates LINE and Dify, retrieving sales data from Google Sheets based on the extracted JAN code and sending it back to LINE[1]. The author, a retail store employee, created this to reduce time spent checking sales data, ultimately improving manufacturing accuracy[1].
